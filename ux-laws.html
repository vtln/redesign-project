                        <h2>Analysis: Laws of UX</h2>
                        <p>When you visit multiple websites, do you ever wonder why most of them look the same? This is mostly due to designers 
                            following what we call “Laws of UX.” These laws set up the foundation for web page and application design. Today, I 
                            will explore two specific laws: Miller’s Law and the Law of Proximity. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class = "col-lg-4 col-md-4 p-before">
                        <img src = "/images/miller-law.png" alt = "example of miller's law">
                    </div>

                    <div class = "col-lg-8 col-md-8 p-before">
                        <h3>Miller's Law</h3>
                        <p>Miller’s Law, defined by Dictionary.com, is “the observation that the number of items an average adult can hold in 
                            short-term memory is seven (plus or minus two)”. The purpose of this law is to allow for users to interpret a list of 
                            options in a way that doesn’t require them to think twice about what is in front of them. A perfect example of this is 
                            navigation bars on e-commerce websites such as H&M or Zara.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            With these e-commerce businesses offering many options, 
                            they would have to organize these options in a way where it wouldn’t cause fatigue to their customers. With this example 
                            in mind, I would use Miller’s Law to group my navigation bar in a way where my users can find what they are looking for. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Additionally, this would apply throughout my website in terms of the dropdown menu for my projects. While I have many 
                            projects that potential recruiters could review, I only left two projects in the dropdown menu with the option of looking 
                            at a page of all my compiled projects.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class = "col-lg-4 col-md-4 p-img">
                        <img src = "/images/proximity-law.png" alt = "example of proximity law"> 
                    </div>
                
                    <div class = "col-lg-8 col-md-8 p-before">
                        <h3>Law of Proximity</h3>
                        <p>The Law of Proximity, also defined by Dictionary.com, is " the idea that things that are closer together are perceived as 
                            more related than things that are far apart”. This law applies a psychological concept to design for users to seamlessly process
                            patterns where they can identify which items are similar and which items aren’t.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            An example of where I have seen them in place is on news websites where articles are grouped based on the category that 
                            they fall in. For example, news articles about crime would be in one group while news articles about technology would be 
                            in another. A further breakdown of this example is shown in my homepage with how the articles are organized. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To clarify, for every article, there is an image, a description, and finally followed by a button that have a small amount 
                            of space between them whereas the space between “The Impact of UI/UX Design on Web Development” and “UX Design Club at UTA” is much larger. Based on the law of proximity, 
                            the user would automatically perceive that the image, description, and the button are all part of one article.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class = "col-lg-12 p-after">
                        <p>As I have applied these two concepts to my current website already, I would continue to use these applications in the future websites and 
                            applications that I build. I believe that the concepts that I have learned throughout this semester have given me a foundational understanding 
                            of how to build websites for users, by a chronically online user. </p>
